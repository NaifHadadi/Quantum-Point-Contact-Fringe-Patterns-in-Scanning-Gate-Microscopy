![SURE203 Poster Naif Haddadi](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a550f28-e551-4e38-b730-f9fa14a7aab8)


This repository provides simulations and basic analytical models to study fringe patterns in **Scanning Gate Microscopy (SGM)** of **Quantum Point Contacts (QPCs)**.

### Included:

-  Simple toy model using Green’s functions  
-  Parameter studies: gate voltage, hopping, tip position  
- Comparisons with more realistic models
- Curve fitting for experimental-style fringe data
